FindStudentByIndex in the implementation of arrays has the constant run time of O(1) as it can be accessed just by the index you're looking for. In the Linked List implementation the run time is O(n) as you must iterate through n amount of nodes in the linked list. This makes the array structure more ideal for this method. For the findStudentByName method, both the array and the Linked list implementation has the run time of O(n) making one not better than the other. RemoveStudent with the use of a LinkedList has a run time of O(1). RemoveStudent using arrays has a run time of O(n) since you have to shift elements around, making Linked Lists better for this method.
